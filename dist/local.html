          Before going with San Diego Solar, I received quotes from others, including people I knew in the industry.  Dirk gave me the best price.  But price was just the beginning.  He determined exactly how many panels were best for my install by studying past electric bills.  He and his crew did a fantastic job timely installing and explaining the system to me.  Dirk helped with the rebates and always took time to answer all my questions (and I had a lot).  In my experience, Dirk is not only an expert in the field he is also an honest businessman that is great to work with.  Thanks to San Diego Solar, I either have no electric bill (summer months) or a very small electric bill. Dirk and his team were great! I have told all my colleagues about him.

        <h3>Going Big often means going it alone for your warranty. </h3>
        <p>
          The big out of town companies come in with big sales goals and lots of install crews. Also big overhead. When the sales go down they disappear, going belly up before the warranty costs start rising.
        </p>
        <p>
          The big problems arise because those multiple numbers of crews often only have minimal roofing flashing training for some of the guys.  The big companies actually have leak teams that have to run around when it rains fixing leaks. We know because they headhunt and steal our guys for the leak teams.
        </p>
        <p>
          We sleep well when it rains because we have a small number of crews and every guy is trained properly to journeyman levels.

                    Just did ANOTHER solar install with Dirk and his team. I was remodeling a house and knew to call Dirk and his brother. It is so much more convenient (and less expensive) when your solar installer is ALSO a licensed roofer. Dirk and his brother Brad coordinated
                    all the electrical, solar, skylights and roofing into one solidly done job. It speaks to their attention to detail and quality when the boss is right up on that roof alongside his workers.

                    We love our solar electricity! Dirk and Brad explained all of our options. They took the time to examine several options and help us design a system that was perfect for us. As a custom residential architect function and aesthetics are both very important
                    to me. They helped us design a system that is practically hidden from view but yet is using the optimal panel locations for generating the most electricity. The crew that installed the panels were thoughtful and patient in answering
                    all of my questions. They kept a clean and organized job site and efficiently installed the system in less than a week. We found them purely by recommendation from an Engineer I work with. I am so glad we used them and will be recommending
                    them to all my clients and friends.

                    We're really glad our neighbor recommended San Diego Solar for our new roof! Brad was always very helpful and responsive when we had any questions and concerns. With the holidays and rain season, we really wanted to finish our roof asap, and Brad and
                    his team were so understanding and we really felt that they tried very hard to make sure we had our new roof asap. Everyone came to our house first thing in the morning at the scheduled time and worked hard until after the sun set.
                    They were also very polite and respectful, not only to us but also our neighbors and our property, they cleaned up everything at the end of each day. We are very happy with our finished roof, the price was very reasonable, it looks
                    great, and we feel confident that we can trust it's good quality. We will definitely recommend them to everyone who wants to install roof and solar system!

                    After consulting with no less than five solar contractors, we were so glad that our neighbor had Dirk install his very large commercial grade panels and he was very satisfied with his solar system. Our 8,000 watt system consists of 40 panels and has been
                    up and running now for 10 months. Our meter spins backwards faster than it ever ran forward, even with the pool pump and A/C on! Dirk is the owner and was personally involved with every aspect of the planning, permits, installation
                    and rebate process. The county inspector said that it is very rare to have an inspection pass on the first time, but he congratulated Dirk on a fine job and everything passed right away with no problems. Even when the power went off
                    for a full day during the high winds up in the mountains, we were able to plug into the inverters in the garage and use the electricity directly from the panels as long as the sun was shining - so nice to not have to start up the generator
                    to keep the refrigerator and communication devices running. My wife and i would definitely recommend Dirk to anyone who asks, and since our system was set up two of my friends have used his company and are also very happy. It is amazing
                    how expensive the big companies are when you compare dollars to watts. There was a huge markup on the panels and installation with many of the other companies we considered. What was also interesting was the most expensive company
                    also had the worst reviews! If you are even just considering going solar, and we are sure glad that we did, you owe it to yourself to check around but don't decide until you talk to Dirk. He is very low key and really knows his stuff,
                    as he is also the electrician who personally made the connections. Thanks so much for taking care of us and doing everything as promised! One more thing: he also re-roofed half of our house where the panels would go as the original
                    roofers had not done a very good job, and the extra cost for this was about a third of what it would have cost to hire a separate roofing company, plus the cost all went towards the solar installation so we were able to take advantage
                    of a bigger tax break. Go Solar - you will be glad you did, and thanks again Dirk for a wonderful experience from start to finish!

                    San Diego Solar crushed it out of the park when it came to service and reliability. We were worried about getting it installed by the end of the year and they made it happen. We interviewed a bunch of different companies and SD Solar was by far the best
                    price and value for our dollar. Dirk and Brad are excellent salesman and stand behind their work. I have recommended them to many other friends who are jumping on board the solar bandwagon.

                    Dirk and his company exceeded all of my expectations. The price was phenomenal, the installation was flawless, and the system operates better that expected. We used to pay between $200-$300 per month on electricity. Our bill is now anywhere from $0-$10.
                    Thanks San Diego Solar.

                    Dirk and his team were great! I have told all my colleagues about him. I had contacted several solar installers (including the big guys) and either got empty promises or felt like I was getting a sales pitch. I never felt confident that I wasn't being
                    taken advantage of. But Dirk was different. He actually took into account my situation and advised me what I really needed and how I could expand my system in the future instead of overselling me. He showed me where I could save money
                    and talked me out of extras I didn't need. He did what was best for me, not what was easiest/cheapest for him. Dirk and his crew showed up exactly when he told me he would start my install and finished on time. They cleaned up everyday.
                    He even showed me that some of the seals on my roof were cracking and offered to fix them while he was up there anyway. I couldn't be happier with my solar and I know I got a good install and at a fantastic price. The other guys quotes
                    I now know were WAY inflated. I'm so glad I used Dirk and not some company that recently just jumped on the solar bandwagon. Call Dirk for a quote. You won't be sorry.

                    Was very happy we went with Dirk and Brad! They were referred to us by two different friends who had used them for their solar and roofing work. They were extremely friendly, courteous and also were super competitive on price while installing top quality
                    panels. They did the work right the first time!

                    San Diego Solar came highly recommended and they did not disappoint.  Very professional, always on time, always did what they said they would do.  Rarely do I bother writing anything on Yelp because most just don't live up to my expectations so rather than give a luke warm review I just remain silent.  Not only are Dirk and Brad great to work with they also hire excellent people.  Somehow 5 Stars just does not seem enough for San Diego Solar.  Thanks guys for a job well done.

                    These guys were amazing! If you are looking for an honest, fair and knowledgeable team who perform clean work, this is the best solar company out there. I had a few quotes and these guys delivered exactly what they promised and went out of their way to accommodate our association guidelines. Our system is up and running and we already have saved hundreds of dollars and well on our way to $0 monthly electric bill!!

                    San Diego Solar goes above and beyond to make sure a quality solar solution is installed.  Starting with the owner Dirk Hosmer who personally oversees and works on my entire project.  I've dealt with many contractors over the years and I can honestly say that Dirk stands alone in responsiveness, reliability, communication and most important to me, providing a bid and sticking to it with no "add-ons".  His upfront estimate was exactly what the total cost ended up being, which in the contracting arena seems to be unheard of.  Prior to choosing San Diego Solar I did my due diligence in researching all potential solar solutions and I got multiple bids.  Without hesitation or reservation I highly recommend San Diego Solar!

                    After consulting with no less than five solar contractors, we were so glad that our neighbor had Dirk install his very large commercial grade panels and he was very satisfied with his solar system. Our 8,000 watt system consists of 40 panels and has been up and running now for 10 months. Our meter spins backwards faster than it ever ran forward, even with the pool pump and A/C on! Dirk is the owner and was personally involved with every aspect of the planning, permits, installation and rebate process.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The county inspector  said that it is very rare to have an inspection pass on the first time, but he congratulated Dirk on a fine job and everything passed right away with no problems. Even when the power went off for a full day during the high winds up in the mountains, we were able to plug into the inverters in the garage and use the electricity directly from the panels as long as the sun was shining - so nice to not have to start up the generator to keep the refrigerator and communication devices running.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    My wife and I would definitely recommend Dirk to anyone who asks, and since our system was set up two of my friends have used his company and are also very happy. It is amazing how expensive the big companies are when you compare dollars to watts. There was a huge markup on the panels and installation with many of the other companies we considered. What was also interesting was the most expensive company also had the worst reviews!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you are even just considering going solar, and we are sure glad that we did, you owe it to yourself to check around but don't decide until you talk to Dirk. He is very low key and really knows his stuff, as he is also the electrician who personally made the connections. Thanks so much for taking care of us and doing everything as promised! One more thing: he also re-roofed half of our house where the panels would go as the original roofers had not done a very good job, and the extra cost for this was about a third of what it would have cost to hire a separate roofing company, plus the cost all went towards the solar installation so we were able to take advantage of a bigger tax break. Go Solar - you will be glad you did, and thanks again Dirk for a wonderful experience from start to finish!

              <p>
                At the end of 2015, there was just north of 25 gigawatts (GW) of solar PV installed in the United States. Now, after back-to-back years of double-digit gigawatt growth (15 GW in 2016 and 10.6 GW in 2017), the solar industry has more than doubled its total installed capacity to 53.3 GW through the end of 2017.

                BOSTON, Mass. and WASHINGTON D.C. – In 2017, the U.S. solar market expanded, adding double-digit gigawatt solar photovoltaic (PV) additions for the second year in a row. According to the newly released U.S. Solar Market Insight Report 2017 Year-in-Review from GTM Research and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), the solar industry installed 10.6 gigawatts (GW) of new PV capacity in 2017, led by strong growth in the corporate and community solar segments.

(February 20, 2018) – The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) commended legislation filed in the California Legislature on Friday that would make it easier for businesses, schools, nonprofits and municipalities to access solar energy. In turn, this will help generate thousands of new jobs and millions of dollars of investment in the state.

          Dirk and his company exceeded all of my expectations.  The price was phenomenal, the installation was flawless, and the system operates better that expected.  We used to pay between $200-$300 per month on electricity.  Our bill is now anywhere from $0-$10.  Thanks San Diego Solar.

                <h1>After Back-to-Back Years of Double-Digit Growth, U.S. Solar Passes 50 GW Milestone</h1>
                <h6>Thursday, Mar 15 2018</h6><br>
                <p>At the end of 2015, there was just north of 25 gigawatts (GW) of solar PV installed in the United States. Now, after back-to-back years of double-digit gigawatt growth (15 GW in 2016 and 10.6 GW in 2017), the solar industry has more than doubled its total installed capacity to <b>53.3 GW</b> through the end of&nbsp;2017.</p>

                <p>Today’s release of the <a href="https://www.seia.org/us-solar-market-insight" target="_blank">U.S. Solar Market Insight 2017 Year in Review</a> finds that the solar industry is doing pretty well, even after a year of obstacles, from the trade case to a number of state policy&nbsp;actions.</p>

                <p>While capacity installed last year was down from 2016 due to factors like trade uncertainty, PURPA project cancellations and interconnection delays, the 10.6 GW installed account for nearly 20 percent of all currently installed solar in the U.S. Installations last year were up 40 percent over&nbsp;2015.</p>

                <p>The biggest market standout last year has to be the non-residential sector, which grew by 28 percent year-over-year, led by robust community solar pipelines in Minnesota and Massachusetts and major commercial solar procurement nationwide. Minnesota actually installed more megawatts of community solar in 2017 than the total of U.S. community solar installations in all of&nbsp;2016!</p>

                <p>These gains in the states are the real story of this new report. Florida, the Sunshine State, has overtaken New York in the top ten states for installed solar, adding nearly 750 megawatts of PV. That’s double what the state had installed through&nbsp;2016.</p>


                <p>All of this growth caused solar to account for 30 percent of new electric generating capacity brought online in the U.S. last year, second only to natural gas. Look out for solar consistently taking the top spot in years to come. Total installed U.S. PV capacity is expected to more than double over the next five years, and by 2023, more than 15 GW of PV will be installed annually, according to the&nbsp;projections.</p>

                <p>Despite obstacles, solar will continue to hum on its way to becoming America’s single largest source of new electric generating capacity over the next decade. SEIA is prepared to lead the industry to those heights. There is nothing in this year’s report that suggests that we are not well on the&nbsp;way.</p>

                <h1>U.S. Solar Market Adds 10.6 GW of PV in 2017, Community Solar Soars</h1>
                <h6>Thursday, Mar 15 2018</h6><br>
                <p>
                  BOSTON, Mass. and WASHINGTON D.C.  – In 2017, the U.S. solar market expanded, adding double-digit gigawatt solar photovoltaic (PV) additions for the second year in a row. According to the newly released <a href="http://www2.seia.org/e/139231/smi/28tjvw/221974624" target="_blank">U.S. Solar Market Insight Report 2017 Year-in-Review</a> from GTM Research and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), the solar industry installed 10.6 gigawatts (GW) of new PV capacity in 2017, led by strong growth in the corporate and community solar segments.<br><br>
                  While overall growth was down from the 15 GW installed in the record-shattering 2016, last year’s capacity addition still represents 40 percent growth over 2015’s installation total.<br><br>
                  "The solar industry delivered impressively last year despite a trade case and market adjustments," said SEIA President and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper. "Especially encouraging is the increasing geographic diversity in states deploying solar, from the Southeast to the Midwest, that led to a double digit increase in total capacity."<br><br>
                  The non-residential market segment got its moment in the spotlight in 2017, growing 28 percent year-over-year, notching its fourth straight year of annual growth. Last year in particular saw an "explosion" in the community solar market, led by Minnesota and Massachusetts.<br><br>
                  "Minnesota headlined a banner year for community solar, with more megawatts installed in that state than total U.S. community solar installations in all of 2016," said Austin Perea, GTM Research solar analyst and co-author of the report. "We expect community solar to diversify geographically in 2018, with Maryland and New York to be key growth markets for the sub-segment beginning this year." <br>
                  <br>
                  However, the residential and utility-scale segments saw installations fall on an annual basis for the first time since GTM Research and SEIA began publishing the report in 2010.<br><br>The year-over-year downturn for the utility segment in 2017 was largely expected, due to the massive influx of installations seen in 2016 as projects were rushed to completion before the anticipated expiration of the 30 percent federal Investment Tax Credit. The report notes that uncertainty surrounding the Section 201 tariffs caused many projects to be postponed or canceled, while interconnection delays and PURPA cancellation resulted in many projects spilling over into 2018.<br><br>Of the top 10 state markets for residential solar in 2016, only two saw annual growth in 2017. However, 25 of the 44 states tracked in the report saw year-over-year growth in annual residential PV installations with several states climbing up in the rankings.<br><br>Florida managed to break into the top 10 states for the first time since 2011, jumping to the No. 10 spot for cumulative solar capacity installed. Over the last year, South Carolina also saw big gains, moving up 9 spots in the new rankings to No. 18 in the U.S.
                  <br><br>California and North Carolina remain the two largest solar states after adding the most and second-most capacity in 2017, respectively.<br><br>Because of the federal and state policy changes and market dynamics, GTM Research lowered its base-case forecast for 2018-2022 by 13 percent. Still, total installed U.S. PV capacity is expected to more than double over the next five years, and by 2023, more than 15 GW of PV capacity will be installed annually.</p>

                <h1>President’s Decision on Solar Tariffs is a Loss for America</h1>
                <h6>Monday, Jan 22 2018</h6><br>
                <p>WASHINGTON, D.C. - The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) – the national trade association for the U.S. industry -  and its members expressed disappointment in the decision by President Trump to impose 30 percent tariffs on imported solar cells and panels.<br><br>The decision effectively will cause the loss of roughly 23,000 American jobs this year, including many in manufacturing, and it will result in the delay or cancellation of billions of dollars in solar investments.<br><br>"While tariffs in this case will not create adequate cell or module manufacturing to meet U.S. demand, or keep foreign-owned Suniva and SolarWorld afloat, they will create a crisis in a part of our economy that has been thriving, which will ultimately cost tens of thousands of hard-working, blue-collar Americans their jobs," said Abigail Ross Hopper, SEIA’s President and CEO.<br><br>The impact of the decision will be far-reaching across all sectors of the solar economy, SEIA members said.<br><br>"It boggles my mind that this president - any president, really - would voluntarily choose to damage one of the fastest-growing segments of our economy," said Tony Clifford, chief development officer, Standard Solar. "This decision is misguided and denies the reality that bankrupt foreign companies will be the beneficiaries of an American taxpayer bailout."<br><br>SEIA estimates that a tariff at this level will eliminate, not add to, American manufacturing jobs. There were 38,000 jobs in solar manufacturing in the U.S. at the end of 2016, and all but 2,000 made something other than cells and panels, the subject of this case. Those 36,000 Americans manufactured metal racking systems, high-tech inverters, machines that improved solar panel output by tracking the sun and other electrical products.<br><br>"There’s no doubt this decision will hurt U.S. manufacturing, not help it," said Bill Vietas, president of RBI Solar in Cincinnati. "The U.S. solar manufacturing sector has been growing as our industry has surged over the past five years. Government tariffs will increase the cost of solar and depress demand, which will reduce the orders we’re getting and cost manufacturing workers their jobs." <br><br> "This is a bad day for the U.S.," said Costa Nicolaou, president and CEO of PanelClaw, an American racking company. "What’s most disappointing is that the president sided with two foreign-owned companies and didn’t listen to Americans from across the country and political spectrum who understood tariffs will cause great economic pain for so many families in the solar sector."<br><br>While the case will undoubtedly have negative effects on the industry, SEIA pointed out that the tariffs were nowhere near as bad as what Suniva and SolarWorld requested.  SEIA also looks forward to working with interested parties to achieve a positive outcome in the existing antidumping and countervailing duty cases.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>
                  "While we believe the decision will be significantly harmful to our industry and the economy, we appreciate that the president and the administration listened to our arguments," Hopper said. "Our industry will emerge from this. The case for solar energy is just too strong to be held down for long, but the severe near-term impacts of these tariffs are unfortunate and&nbsp;avoidable."

                <p><b>SACRAMENTO, Calif. and WASHINGTON, D.C. (February 20, 2018) </b>– The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) commended legislation filed in the California Legislature on Friday that would make it easier for businesses, schools, nonprofits and municipalities to access solar energy. In turn, this will help generate thousands of new jobs and millions of dollars of investment in the&nbsp;state.</p>

                <p>"California has long been our nation’s leader in solar energy, but many of its businesses and schools face practical barriers to adopting solar," said Sean Gallagher, SEIA’s vice president of state affairs. "This bill provides an innovative, yet commonsense solution that will unlock access to local clean energy for these organizations, while creating thousands of jobs in California. We thank Sen. Wiener for his leadership in advancing California’s solar&nbsp;economy."</p>

                <p>The bill, SB 1399, was authored by California Sen. Scott Wiener, who represents San Francisco and parts of San Mateo County. The legislation expands access to offsite solar projects for non-residential customers, by allowing them to partner with already-developed sites – such as parking lots, warehouses, brownfields and landfills – and use those sites for solar energy that the local community can&nbsp;access.</p>

                <p>"To meet our aggressive renewable energy goals, California needs to dramatically expand solar, including maximizing use of our empty rooftops and other developed spaces that are ripe for solar," said Senator Wiener. "However, these locations sometimes have no need for solar power and therefore sit unused, while other energy customers want to access renewable energy but have no space to install solar. SB 1399 brings these two groups together – supply and demand – to drive an increase in solar installations in urbanized areas throughout California. SB 1399 will spur the generation of more clean energy and create more good-paying solar installation jobs in communities throughout our&nbsp;state."</p>

                <p>California has an abundance of previously developed sites — 35,000 acres in total, including 20,000 in disadvantaged communities — that could provide ideal locations for solar energy. This bill establishes a pathway for non-residential customers to take advantage of clean energy and enhance both the built environment and the local&nbsp;economy.</p>

                <p>SEIA urges the California Legislature to pass this bill, and allow solar to deliver more clean, reliable, affordable power to businesses, schools, public agencies and nonprofits in the&nbsp;state.</p>
