            <h4>SAVE MONEY</h4>
            <p>
              By generating your own electric power you will reduce your reliance on your local power utility. This will provide insulation from inflation and future utility rate hikes. You can save thousands of dollars annually for years to come.
            </p>
            <p>
              A solar electric system for your home is typically an excellent investment that pays for itself and offers exceptional ROI (Return on investment).
            </p>

            <img src="img/san-diego-solar-clean-energy-renewable.png" />
            <h4>USE CLEAN, RENEWABLE ENERGY</h4>
            <p>
              Together, we can create an energy market where renewable energy offers the opportunity to save money AND leave a cleaner planet for future generations.
            </p>
            <p>
              The renewable energy revolution has begun and as conscientious citizens we should allow no barriers to continued adoption of renewable energy with the goal of replacing carbon emitting fossil fuels entirely.

            <h4>INCREASE PROPERTY VALUE</h4>
            <p>
              In California, a small 3.1 kilowatt (kW) system can add an average of $18,324 to the value of a medium-sized home, whereas installing 5kW of solar panels adds an average of $29,555 to the retail value of a medium-sized home.
            </p>
            <p>As a future seller, can demand a higher asking price for your home, reduce exposure time on the market listings (sell your home (on average) 20x faster).</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="col-xs-offset-0 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-3 col-md-offset-0">
          <div class="boxes">
            <img src="img/san-diego-solar-rely-less-utilities.png" />
            <h4>REDUCE RELIANCE ON UTILITIES</h4>
            <p>
              Net metering is where the amount of energy you buy in from the grid and the amount of excess solar energy you export to the grid are recorded separately and you are only billed for the net of these two numbers.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you buy in 1000 kWh of electricity over a month at times when your solar is either not generating (night time or cloudy day), but you export 500 kWh of energy to the grid in the same month when your solar is producing more energy than your house is
              using, then you would be billed for only 500 kWh.
            </p>

            <img src="img/left-quote.png" class="left-quote" /> After consulting with no less than five solar contractors, we were so glad that our neighbor had Dirk install his very large commercial grade panels and he was very satisfied with his solar
            system. Our 8,000 watt system consists of 40 panels and has been up and running now for 10 months. Our meter spins backwards faster than it ever ran forward, even with the pool pump and A/C on! Dirk is the owner and was personally involved
            with every aspect of the planning, permits, installation and rebate process.

        Ben Airth and Sachu Constantine of the Center for Sustainable Energy explain how solar plus storage can strengthen California’s electric grid — and the importance of good government policy in helping it do so.
      </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        When it comes to solar electric power, California has a good thing going – perhaps too good. Too much clean, affordable, abundant energy? It’s true because high levels of solar production from utility-scale facilities and widely distributed rooftop installations
        occur during daytime hours when demand may not be at its peak and grid-supplied electricity is plentiful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seasonally, and under certain conditions, this leads to an oversupply of energy on the grid and requires curtailment of generation resources, including wind and solar. We should see this as an opportunity to further reduce fossil fuel generation and to
        build a more robust, resilient and efficient grid.
      </p>

      <p>
        When pairing solar with battery storage systems on a wide scale, Californians can not only save money, but also reduce strain on the grid and mitigate the Duck Curve. With nearly instantaneous response time, battery storage can smoothly ramp up and regulate
        supply, displacing peaker plants while simultaneously decreasing intermittency (power that is not continuously available). Energy storage also enhances resiliency, and defers utility transmission and distribution upgrades — all of which will save
        ratepayers in the long run. The potential social benefits are substantial, including cost savings, expanded consumer choice, a cleaner environment and robust clean-tech market and job growth.

                    Just did ANOTHER solar install with Dirk and his team. I was remodeling a house and knew to call Dirk and his brother. It is so much more convenient (and less expensive) when your solar installer is ALSO a licensed roofer. Dirk and his brother Brad coordinated
                    all the electrical, solar, skylights and roofing into one solidly done job. It speaks to their attention to detail and quality when the boss is right up on that roof alongside his workers.

                    We love our solar electricity! Dirk and Brad explained all of our options. They took the time to examine several options and help us design a system that was perfect for us. As a custom residential architect function and aesthetics are both very important
                    to me. They helped us design a system that is practically hidden from view but yet is using the optimal panel locations for generating the most electricity. The crew that installed the panels were thoughtful and patient in answering
                    all of my questions. They kept a clean and organized job site and efficiently installed the system in less than a week. We found them purely by recommendation from an Engineer I work with. I am so glad we used them and will be recommending
                    them to all my clients and friends.

                    We're really glad our neighbor recommended San Diego Solar for our new roof! Brad was always very helpful and responsive when we had any questions and concerns. With the holidays and rain season, we really wanted to finish our roof asap, and Brad and
                    his team were so understanding and we really felt that they tried very hard to make sure we had our new roof asap. Everyone came to our house first thing in the morning at the scheduled time and worked hard until after the sun set.
                    They were also very polite and respectful, not only to us but also our neighbors and our property, they cleaned up everything at the end of each day. We are very happy with our finished roof, the price was very reasonable, it looks
                    great, and we feel confident that we can trust it's good quality. We will definitely recommend them to everyone who wants to install roof and solar system!

                    Before going with San Diego Solar, I received quotes from others, including people I knew in the industry. Dirk gave me the best price. But price was just the beginning. He determined exactly how many panels were best for my install by studying past electric
                    bills. He and his crew did a fantastic job timely installing and explaining the system to me. Dirk helped with the rebates and always took time to answer all my questions (and I had a lot). In my experience, Dirk is not only an expert
                    in the field he is also an honest businessman that is great to work with. Thanks to San Diego Solar, I either have no electric bill (summer months) or a very small electric bill.

                    After consulting with no less than five solar contractors, we were so glad that our neighbor had Dirk install his very large commercial grade panels and he was very satisfied with his solar system. Our 8,000 watt system consists of 40 panels and has been
                    up and running now for 10 months. Our meter spins backwards faster than it ever ran forward, even with the pool pump and A/C on! Dirk is the owner and was personally involved with every aspect of the planning, permits, installation
                    and rebate process. The county inspector said that it is very rare to have an inspection pass on the first time, but he congratulated Dirk on a fine job and everything passed right away with no problems. Even when the power went off
                    for a full day during the high winds up in the mountains, we were able to plug into the inverters in the garage and use the electricity directly from the panels as long as the sun was shining - so nice to not have to start up the generator
                    to keep the refrigerator and communication devices running. My wife and i would definitely recommend Dirk to anyone who asks, and since our system was set up two of my friends have used his company and are also very happy. It is amazing
                    how expensive the big companies are when you compare dollars to watts. There was a huge markup on the panels and installation with many of the other companies we considered. What was also interesting was the most expensive company
                    also had the worst reviews! If you are even just considering going solar, and we are sure glad that we did, you owe it to yourself to check around but don't decide until you talk to Dirk. He is very low key and really knows his stuff,
                    as he is also the electrician who personally made the connections. Thanks so much for taking care of us and doing everything as promised! One more thing: he also re-roofed half of our house where the panels would go as the original
                    roofers had not done a very good job, and the extra cost for this was about a third of what it would have cost to hire a separate roofing company, plus the cost all went towards the solar installation so we were able to take advantage
                    of a bigger tax break. Go Solar - you will be glad you did, and thanks again Dirk for a wonderful experience from start to finish!

                    San Diego Solar crushed it out of the park when it came to service and reliability. We were worried about getting it installed by the end of the year and they made it happen. We interviewed a bunch of different companies and SD Solar was by far the best
                    price and value for our dollar. Dirk and Brad are excellent salesman and stand behind their work. I have recommended them to many other friends who are jumping on board the solar bandwagon.

                    Dirk and his company exceeded all of my expectations. The price was phenomenal, the installation was flawless, and the system operates better that expected. We used to pay between $200-$300 per month on electricity. Our bill is now anywhere from $0-$10.
                    Thanks San Diego Solar.

                    Dirk and his team were great! I have told all my colleagues about him. I had contacted several solar installers (including the big guys) and either got empty promises or felt like I was getting a sales pitch. I never felt confident that I wasn't being
                    taken advantage of. But Dirk was different. He actually took into account my situation and advised me what I really needed and how I could expand my system in the future instead of overselling me. He showed me where I could save money
                    and talked me out of extras I didn't need. He did what was best for me, not what was easiest/cheapest for him. Dirk and his crew showed up exactly when he told me he would start my install and finished on time. They cleaned up everyday.
                    He even showed me that some of the seals on my roof were cracking and offered to fix them while he was up there anyway. I couldn't be happier with my solar and I know I got a good install and at a fantastic price. The other guys quotes
                    I now know were WAY inflated. I'm so glad I used Dirk and not some company that recently just jumped on the solar bandwagon. Call Dirk for a quote. You won't be sorry.

                    Was very happy we went with Dirk and Brad! They were referred to us by two different friends who had used them for their solar and roofing work. They were extremely friendly, courteous and also were super competitive on price while installing top quality
                    panels. They did the work right the first time!

                    San Diego Solar came highly recommended and they did not disappoint.  Very professional, always on time, always did what they said they would do.  Rarely do I bother writing anything on Yelp because most just don't live up to my expectations so rather than give a luke warm review I just remain silent.  Not only are Dirk and Brad great to work with they also hire excellent people.  Somehow 5 Stars just does not seem enough for San Diego Solar.  Thanks guys for a job well done.

                    These guys were amazing! If you are looking for an honest, fair and knowledgeable team who perform clean work, this is the best solar company out there. I had a few quotes and these guys delivered exactly what they promised and went out of their way to accommodate our association guidelines. Our system is up and running and we already have saved hundreds of dollars and well on our way to $0 monthly electric bill!!

                    San Diego Solar goes above and beyond to make sure a quality solar solution is installed.  Starting with the owner Dirk Hosmer who personally oversees and works on my entire project.  I've dealt with many contractors over the years and I can honestly say that Dirk stands alone in responsiveness, reliability, communication and most important to me, providing a bid and sticking to it with no "add-ons".  His upfront estimate was exactly what the total cost ended up being, which in the contracting arena seems to be unheard of.  Prior to choosing San Diego Solar I did my due diligence in researching all potential solar solutions and I got multiple bids.  Without hesitation or reservation I highly recommend San Diego Solar!

                    After consulting with no less than five solar contractors, we were so glad that our neighbor had Dirk install his very large commercial grade panels and he was very satisfied with his solar system. Our 8,000 watt system consists of 40 panels and has been up and running now for 10 months. Our meter spins backwards faster than it ever ran forward, even with the pool pump and A/C on! Dirk is the owner and was personally involved with every aspect of the planning, permits, installation and rebate process.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The county inspector  said that it is very rare to have an inspection pass on the first time, but he congratulated Dirk on a fine job and everything passed right away with no problems. Even when the power went off for a full day during the high winds up in the mountains, we were able to plug into the inverters in the garage and use the electricity directly from the panels as long as the sun was shining - so nice to not have to start up the generator to keep the refrigerator and communication devices running.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    My wife and I would definitely recommend Dirk to anyone who asks, and since our system was set up two of my friends have used his company and are also very happy. It is amazing how expensive the big companies are when you compare dollars to watts. There was a huge markup on the panels and installation with many of the other companies we considered. What was also interesting was the most expensive company also had the worst reviews!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you are even just considering going solar, and we are sure glad that we did, you owe it to yourself to check around but don't decide until you talk to Dirk. He is very low key and really knows his stuff, as he is also the electrician who personally made the connections. Thanks so much for taking care of us and doing everything as promised! One more thing: he also re-roofed half of our house where the panels would go as the original roofers had not done a very good job, and the extra cost for this was about a third of what it would have cost to hire a separate roofing company, plus the cost all went towards the solar installation so we were able to take advantage of a bigger tax break. Go Solar - you will be glad you did, and thanks again Dirk for a wonderful experience from start to finish!

                    Just did ANOTHER solar install with Dirk and his team. I was remodeling a house and knew to call Dirk and his brother. It is so much more convenient (and less expensive) when your solar installer is ALSO a licensed roofer. Dirk and his brother Brad coordinated
                    all the electrical, solar, skylights and roofing into one solidly done job. It speaks to their attention to detail and quality when the boss is right up on that roof alongside his workers.

                    We love our solar electricity! Dirk and Brad explained all of our options. They took the time to examine several options and help us design a system that was perfect for us. As a custom residential architect function and aesthetics are both very important
                    to me. They helped us design a system that is practically hidden from view but yet is using the optimal panel locations for generating the most electricity. The crew that installed the panels were thoughtful and patient in answering
                    all of my questions. They kept a clean and organized job site and efficiently installed the system in less than a week. We found them purely by recommendation from an Engineer I work with. I am so glad we used them and will be recommending
                    them to all my clients and friends.

                    We're really glad our neighbor recommended San Diego Solar for our new roof! Brad was always very helpful and responsive when we had any questions and concerns. With the holidays and rain season, we really wanted to finish our roof asap, and Brad and
                    his team were so understanding and we really felt that they tried very hard to make sure we had our new roof asap. Everyone came to our house first thing in the morning at the scheduled time and worked hard until after the sun set.
                    They were also very polite and respectful, not only to us but also our neighbors and our property, they cleaned up everything at the end of each day. We are very happy with our finished roof, the price was very reasonable, it looks
                    great, and we feel confident that we can trust it's good quality. We will definitely recommend them to everyone who wants to install roof and solar system!

                    Before going with San Diego Solar, I received quotes from others, including people I knew in the industry. Dirk gave me the best price. But price was just the beginning. He determined exactly how many panels were best for my install by studying past electric
                    bills. He and his crew did a fantastic job timely installing and explaining the system to me. Dirk helped with the rebates and always took time to answer all my questions (and I had a lot). In my experience, Dirk is not only an expert
                    in the field he is also an honest businessman that is great to work with. Thanks to San Diego Solar, I either have no electric bill (summer months) or a very small electric bill.

                    San Diego Solar crushed it out of the park when it came to service and reliability. We were worried about getting it installed by the end of the year and they made it happen. We interviewed a bunch of different companies and SD Solar was by far the best
                    price and value for our dollar. Dirk and Brad are excellent salesman and stand behind their work. I have recommended them to many other friends who are jumping on board the solar bandwagon.

                    Dirk and his company exceeded all of my expectations. The price was phenomenal, the installation was flawless, and the system operates better that expected. We used to pay between $200-$300 per month on electricity. Our bill is now anywhere from $0-$10.
                    Thanks San Diego Solar.

                    Dirk and his team were great! I have told all my colleagues about him. I had contacted several solar installers (including the big guys) and either got empty promises or felt like I was getting a sales pitch. I never felt confident that I wasn't being
                    taken advantage of. But Dirk was different. He actually took into account my situation and advised me what I really needed and how I could expand my system in the future instead of overselling me. He showed me where I could save money
                    and talked me out of extras I didn't need. He did what was best for me, not what was easiest/cheapest for him. Dirk and his crew showed up exactly when he told me he would start my install and finished on time. They cleaned up everyday.
                    He even showed me that some of the seals on my roof were cracking and offered to fix them while he was up there anyway. I couldn't be happier with my solar and I know I got a good install and at a fantastic price. The other guys quotes
                    I now know were WAY inflated. I'm so glad I used Dirk and not some company that recently just jumped on the solar bandwagon. Call Dirk for a quote. You won't be sorry.

                    Was very happy we went with Dirk and Brad! They were referred to us by two different friends who had used them for their solar and roofing work. They were extremely friendly, courteous and also were super competitive on price while installing top quality
                    panels. They did the work right the first time!

                    San Diego Solar came highly recommended and they did not disappoint.  Very professional, always on time, always did what they said they would do.  Rarely do I bother writing anything on Yelp because most just don't live up to my expectations so rather than give a luke warm review I just remain silent.  Not only are Dirk and Brad great to work with they also hire excellent people.  Somehow 5 Stars just does not seem enough for San Diego Solar.  Thanks guys for a job well done.

                    These guys were amazing! If you are looking for an honest, fair and knowledgeable team who perform clean work, this is the best solar company out there. I had a few quotes and these guys delivered exactly what they promised and went out of their way to accommodate our association guidelines. Our system is up and running and we already have saved hundreds of dollars and well on our way to $0 monthly electric bill!!

                    San Diego Solar goes above and beyond to make sure a quality solar solution is installed.  Starting with the owner Dirk Hosmer who personally oversees and works on my entire project.  I've dealt with many contractors over the years and I can honestly say that Dirk stands alone in responsiveness, reliability, communication and most important to me, providing a bid and sticking to it with no "add-ons".  His upfront estimate was exactly what the total cost ended up being, which in the contracting arena seems to be unheard of.  Prior to choosing San Diego Solar I did my due diligence in researching all potential solar solutions and I got multiple bids.  Without hesitation or reservation I highly recommend San Diego Solar!

                    After consulting with no less than five solar contractors, we were so glad that our neighbor had Dirk install his very large commercial grade panels and he was very satisfied with his solar system. Our 8,000 watt system consists of 40 panels and has been up and running now for 10 months. Our meter spins backwards faster than it ever ran forward, even with the pool pump and A/C on! Dirk is the owner and was personally involved with every aspect of the planning, permits, installation and rebate process.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The county inspector  said that it is very rare to have an inspection pass on the first time, but he congratulated Dirk on a fine job and everything passed right away with no problems. Even when the power went off for a full day during the high winds up in the mountains, we were able to plug into the inverters in the garage and use the electricity directly from the panels as long as the sun was shining - so nice to not have to start up the generator to keep the refrigerator and communication devices running.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    My wife and I would definitely recommend Dirk to anyone who asks, and since our system was set up two of my friends have used his company and are also very happy. It is amazing how expensive the big companies are when you compare dollars to watts. There was a huge markup on the panels and installation with many of the other companies we considered. What was also interesting was the most expensive company also had the worst reviews!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you are even just considering going solar, and we are sure glad that we did, you owe it to yourself to check around but don't decide until you talk to Dirk. He is very low key and really knows his stuff, as he is also the electrician who personally made the connections. Thanks so much for taking care of us and doing everything as promised! One more thing: he also re-roofed half of our house where the panels would go as the original roofers had not done a very good job, and the extra cost for this was about a third of what it would have cost to hire a separate roofing company, plus the cost all went towards the solar installation so we were able to take advantage of a bigger tax break. Go Solar - you will be glad you did, and thanks again Dirk for a wonderful experience from start to finish!

                <h1>California is set to become the first US state to require virtually all new homes to include solar panels from 2020</h1>
                <h6>Tuesday, July 24 2018</h6><br>
                <p>
                  California is doubling down on its commitment to clean energy. In May, the California Energy Commission (CEC) unanimously approved rules requiring virtually all new residential homes built in the state to be fitted with rooftop solar panels. The new rules will apply from 2020.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The move, which could see 65,000 solar installations a year in the so-called Golden State, won plaudits from the construction industry, and more cautious praise from environmentalists, amid hopes that it would curb statewide carbon emissions and boost values for homeowners.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “This adoption of these standards represents a quantum leap,” California Building Industry Association engineer Robert Raymer told the CEC. “You can bet every state will be watching to see what happens.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Yet the decision is not universally popular. Adding solar panels will increase the cost of a new home by an estimated $9,500 (£7,131), and while homeowners should recoup twice that amount in energy savings over the course of a 30-year mortgage, there are fears that the mandate could exacerbate California’s housing crisis.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Others say the new policy might not deliver significant carbon savings: the state already plans to obtain half its electricity from zero-carbon sources by 2030, so the new rules could potentially boost rooftop solar at the expense of other renewable options, without increasing overall low-carbon generation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “There are quite a few people, especially environmental economists, who want to do something about the climate but think this might not be the right thing to do,” warned Georgia State University economist Garth Heutel.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On the plus side, increased solar generation might force utilities to solve problems they have been avoiding, such as how to feed surplus rooftop energy back into the grid, or how to store daytime solar energy for use during peak hours. Those are pressing issues: California already gets 16 per cent of its electricity from solar, and the state sometimes has to shut down renewable energy facilities, or give away energy to other states, to avoid overburdening its grid.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For now, solar energy advocates are bullish about California’s gamble. If it pays off, it could encourage other states to try bold climate strategies, noted Adam Browning, executive director of advocacy group Vote Solar. “Building smarter is an unambiguous good that should be embraced,” he said. “Things like this will not only push the envelope for solar, but also for other collective solutions to large problems.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Other states might decide that wind power or heat pumps work better for them, Browning added. What is important is that planners seek innovative ways to reduce emissions. “I don’t think it’s going to be ‘Hey everyone, let’s do what California does!’” he said. “But the idea of pushing the envelope, and seeing the benefits of planning for the future, will gain speed.”

                <h1>Distributed solar saved California over $650 million from 2013-2015</h1>
                <h6>Monday, July 16 2018</h6><br>
                <p>
                  A new study finds that from 2013 through 2015, distributed PV reduced peak solar hour mean wholesale electricity prices by 8–9%, avoiding costs of $650–730 million.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One of the most important aspects of the solar power revolution is how it is making daytime electricity cheaper, and thus lowering wholesale electricity prices more broadly. This becomes evident when electricity utilities project no new thermal electricity as the 'lowest cost option'. More evidence of this are contracts being signed today at 2.3¢/kWh, for delivery in just a few years. And this is before we note that distributed solar is saving billions in grid upgrades.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Researchers from Carnegie Mellon and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) have come together to present a new report which puts numbers on these savings. A retrospective analysis of the market price response to distributed photovoltaic generation in California focuses on the wholesale electricity market in California governed by the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) that represents about 80% of the electricity usage in the state.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The research found that distributed PV reduced the ‘hourly mean whole electricity price’ by up to 2.9-3.2¢/kWh, 8-9%, during the peak period of 12-1 PM. This extrapolated to mean that throughout the day, utilities spent between $650-730 million less procuring electricity to provide to their customers. The analysis looked at 15-minute solar electricity production estimates, as this is the interval that generators bid for in the day-ahead market.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The researchers looked across many system sizes and many regions of the state to make sure their data was accurately depicting a broad cross-section of distributed solar power in the state.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The end argument put forth by the authors is that not only will utility scale solar power lower the price of electricity, but so will the many gigawatts of solar power distributed on homes and businesses. This is something we in the field have always known, but now our industry has been around long enough to show it in hard numbers, based on actual data.

                <h1>Residential storage hits new record, deploying 36MWh in Q1</h1>
                <h6>Wed, July 25 2018</h6><br>
                <p>
                  Residential energy storage deployments hit a record in the first quarter, according to the latest U.S. Energy Storage Monitor report from GTM Research and the Energy Storage Association.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There was as much grid-connected residential storage deployed in the first quarter, 36 MWh, as was deployed in the previous three quarters, according to the report.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Much of the increase in residential energy storage deployments can be attributed to changing policies in California and Hawaii, which together accounted for 74% of the residential deployments in the quarter, according to the report.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Both California and Hawaii have made changes to their solar programs over the past few years that resulted in reduced net metering  compensation, which consequently increases incentives for energy storage.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Hawaii, for example, capped its consumer grid supply program and placed an export moratorium on its consumer self-supply program. Both programs were put in place as alternatives to the state's net metering program, which was canceled in 2015.
                </p>
                <p>
                  California is transitioning to time of use (TOU) rates, causing greater customer demand for storage because it will give them greater control over their electricity bills, a senior analyst on energy storage at GTM, Brett Simon, told Utility Dive via email.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The combination of California's TOU rates and the state's Self Generation Incentive Program (SGIP) makes solar-plus-storage almost competitive with solar-only, based on 2018 assumptions, Simon said, adding that solar-plus-storage will be the superior choice for homeowners on TOU rates within a few years.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Solar-plus-storage is, in fact, emerging as a key driver in the growth of the energy storage market. “More than 95% of all residential storage is solar-paired,” Simon said. It is also an important factor in the commercial and industrial and the front-of-the-meter markets (FTM), he said.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Residential storage systems accounted for 28% of the megawatt hours deployed in the first quarter, but the residential segment was second behind the FTM segment, which accounted for 51% of deployments. The non-residential segment, meanwhile, accounted for only 21% of the deployed MWh.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Overall, 126 MWh of energy storage were deployed in the first quarter, a 26% increase from fourth quarter 2017, but a 46% decline year-over-year. But GTM analysts say fourth quarter 2017 was an anomaly because that is when many of the large energy storage projects needed to offset the gas leaks at Aliso Canyon in Southern California came online.
                </p>
                <p>
                  GTM Research sees the energy storage market approaching the 1 GW mark in 2019 and crossing it in 2020. By 2023, BTM energy storage deployments will account for 47% of the annual market, GTM estimates.

                <h1>Reverse power flow: How solar + batteries shift power from utilities to consumers</h1>
                <h3>For 100 years, most decisions about the U.S. electric grid have been made at the top by electric utilities, public regulators, and grid operators. That era has ended.</h3>
                <h6>Sun, July 22 2018</h6><br>
                <p>
                  Small-scale solar has provided one-fifth of new power plant capacity in each of the last four quarters, and over 10 percent in the past five years. One in 5 new California customers of the nation’s largest residential solar company are adding energy storage to their solar arrays. Economic defection––when electricity customers produce most of their own electricity––is not only possible, but rapidly becoming cost-effective. As the flow of power on the grid has shifted one-way to two-way, so has the power to shape the electric grid’s future.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The shift of power into customer hands is already having three, unintended consequences:
                </p>
                <p>
                  Legacy, baseload power plants are becoming financially inferior to clean energy competitors.
                  Electricity sales have stagnated as customers reduce use and produce electricity for themselves.
                  Communities are reaping greater economic rewards from power generation, as electric customers, individually and collectively, produce more locally.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Almost no utility or utility regulator is adequately planning for this fundamental shift. Dozens of utilities across the country have proposed new gas-powered generation that has little chance of remaining online through the end of its economic life due to stiff competition from solar-plus-storage. Some have been approved despite substantial gaps in the economic analysis.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Utility have also made reactionary moves, or made gestures inadequate to address the magnitude of system change. There tend to be three inadequate utility responses to the reversed flow of decision-making power:
                </p>
                <p>
                  Utilities have damaged their reputations by resisting customer interest in distributed energy resources, sending lobbyists to preempt or curtail policies that reward customer-sited and customer-owned power generation.
                  Utility investments in large-scale renewable energy have addressed environmental concerns, but these low-cost power purchases have not delivered reduce electricity prices for end users nor assuaged the interest in over 70 cities of reaching 100% renewable electricity more rapidly.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Utilities have deployed utility-owned distributed energy resources, but in ways that withhold much of the economic or financial benefit from customers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Regulators and state legislators cannot expect incumbent utilities to respond adequately because the rise of economical solar-plus-storage challenges the century-old assumption of a natural electricity distribution monopoly. Instead, electricity market rules should facilitate fair compensation for distributed energy resources and market participants where technology already allows them to compete.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This report details recommendations for changing utility oversight and modifying electricity markets to transition from the dying utility distribution monopoly to a vibrant, democratic energy system where customers have the opportunity to choose distributed energy options that benefit themselves and the greater grid.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Utilities don’t have time to prepare for a future with economical, distributed energy storage because it’s on the doorstep. In 2016, the first hints of a storage-driven transformation of the electricity business came as a “postcard from the future” in Hawaii. Sunrun offered their Brightbox, a combination solar-plus-battery product with a price of 19 cents per kWh, almost 50 percent cheaper than grid electricity. Sunrun began offering its Brightbox service in California in December 2016. By 2018, 1 in 5 new residential Sunrun solar customers in California were choosing to add storage.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These early adopter states just scratch the surface of the competitive landscape.

                  Based on a proxy measure of electricity prices, the combination of on-site solar and energy storage can already compete with the price of serving nearly 26 million residential electricity customers in 19 states.1 The ILSR model compares customers installing a 7-kilowatt-hour Tesla Powerwall and a 5-kilowatt solar array to utility electricity prices, with the percentage of each state’s customers who can generate cheaper power themselves shown on each state:2

                  ILSR’s analysis isn’t alone. According to McKinsey, within three years an Arizona electric customer would be able to serve 80 to 90% of their electricity needs with solar and battery storage, at a lower price than by buying electricity from the utility company.

                  Storage prices have fallen remarkably fast, as illustrated by the remarkable price declinesfor battery  battery storage for solar - prices droppingstorage technology in the last three years (measured in the cost of energy averaged over the expected life of the battery).
