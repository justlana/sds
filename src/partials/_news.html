              <h4>California is set to become the first US state to require virtually all new homes to include solar panels from 2020</h4>
              <p>
                California is doubling down on its commitment to clean energy. In May, the California Energy Commission (CEC) unanimously approved rules requiring virtually all new residential homes built in the state to be fitted with rooftop solar panels. The new rules will apply from 2020.
