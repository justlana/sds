                    Just did ANOTHER solar install with Dirk and his team. I was remodeling a house and knew to call Dirk and his brother. It is so much more convenient (and less expensive) when your solar installer is ALSO a licensed roofer. Dirk and his brother Brad coordinated
                    all the electrical, solar, skylights and roofing into one solidly done job. It speaks to their attention to detail and quality when the boss is right up on that roof alongside his workers.

                    We love our solar electricity! Dirk and Brad explained all of our options. They took the time to examine several options and help us design a system that was perfect for us. As a custom residential architect function and aesthetics are both very important
                    to me. They helped us design a system that is practically hidden from view but yet is using the optimal panel locations for generating the most electricity. The crew that installed the panels were thoughtful and patient in answering
                    all of my questions. They kept a clean and organized job site and efficiently installed the system in less than a week. We found them purely by recommendation from an Engineer I work with. I am so glad we used them and will be recommending
                    them to all my clients and friends.

                    We're really glad our neighbor recommended San Diego Solar for our new roof! Brad was always very helpful and responsive when we had any questions and concerns. With the holidays and rain season, we really wanted to finish our roof asap, and Brad and
                    his team were so understanding and we really felt that they tried very hard to make sure we had our new roof asap. Everyone came to our house first thing in the morning at the scheduled time and worked hard until after the sun set.
                    They were also very polite and respectful, not only to us but also our neighbors and our property, they cleaned up everything at the end of each day. We are very happy with our finished roof, the price was very reasonable, it looks
                    great, and we feel confident that we can trust it's good quality. We will definitely recommend them to everyone who wants to install roof and solar system!

                    Before going with San Diego Solar, I received quotes from others, including people I knew in the industry. Dirk gave me the best price. But price was just the beginning. He determined exactly how many panels were best for my install by studying past electric
                    bills. He and his crew did a fantastic job timely installing and explaining the system to me. Dirk helped with the rebates and always took time to answer all my questions (and I had a lot). In my experience, Dirk is not only an expert
                    in the field he is also an honest businessman that is great to work with. Thanks to San Diego Solar, I either have no electric bill (summer months) or a very small electric bill.

                    After consulting with no less than five solar contractors, we were so glad that our neighbor had Dirk install his very large commercial grade panels and he was very satisfied with his solar system. Our 8,000 watt system consists of 40 panels and has been
                    up and running now for 10 months. Our meter spins backwards faster than it ever ran forward, even with the pool pump and A/C on! Dirk is the owner and was personally involved with every aspect of the planning, permits, installation
                    and rebate process. The county inspector said that it is very rare to have an inspection pass on the first time, but he congratulated Dirk on a fine job and everything passed right away with no problems. Even when the power went off
                    for a full day during the high winds up in the mountains, we were able to plug into the inverters in the garage and use the electricity directly from the panels as long as the sun was shining - so nice to not have to start up the generator
                    to keep the refrigerator and communication devices running. My wife and i would definitely recommend Dirk to anyone who asks, and since our system was set up two of my friends have used his company and are also very happy. It is amazing
                    how expensive the big companies are when you compare dollars to watts. There was a huge markup on the panels and installation with many of the other companies we considered. What was also interesting was the most expensive company
                    also had the worst reviews! If you are even just considering going solar, and we are sure glad that we did, you owe it to yourself to check around but don't decide until you talk to Dirk. He is very low key and really knows his stuff,
                    as he is also the electrician who personally made the connections. Thanks so much for taking care of us and doing everything as promised! One more thing: he also re-roofed half of our house where the panels would go as the original
                    roofers had not done a very good job, and the extra cost for this was about a third of what it would have cost to hire a separate roofing company, plus the cost all went towards the solar installation so we were able to take advantage
                    of a bigger tax break. Go Solar - you will be glad you did, and thanks again Dirk for a wonderful experience from start to finish!

                    San Diego Solar crushed it out of the park when it came to service and reliability. We were worried about getting it installed by the end of the year and they made it happen. We interviewed a bunch of different companies and SD Solar was by far the best
                    price and value for our dollar. Dirk and Brad are excellent salesman and stand behind their work. I have recommended them to many other friends who are jumping on board the solar bandwagon.

                    Dirk and his company exceeded all of my expectations. The price was phenomenal, the installation was flawless, and the system operates better that expected. We used to pay between $200-$300 per month on electricity. Our bill is now anywhere from $0-$10.
                    Thanks San Diego Solar.

                    Dirk and his team were great! I have told all my colleagues about him. I had contacted several solar installers (including the big guys) and either got empty promises or felt like I was getting a sales pitch. I never felt confident that I wasn't being
                    taken advantage of. But Dirk was different. He actually took into account my situation and advised me what I really needed and how I could expand my system in the future instead of overselling me. He showed me where I could save money
                    and talked me out of extras I didn't need. He did what was best for me, not what was easiest/cheapest for him. Dirk and his crew showed up exactly when he told me he would start my install and finished on time. They cleaned up everyday.
                    He even showed me that some of the seals on my roof were cracking and offered to fix them while he was up there anyway. I couldn't be happier with my solar and I know I got a good install and at a fantastic price. The other guys quotes
                    I now know were WAY inflated. I'm so glad I used Dirk and not some company that recently just jumped on the solar bandwagon. Call Dirk for a quote. You won't be sorry.

                    Was very happy we went with Dirk and Brad! They were referred to us by two different friends who had used them for their solar and roofing work. They were extremely friendly, courteous and also were super competitive on price while installing top quality
                    panels. They did the work right the first time!
