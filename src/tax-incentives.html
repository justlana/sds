          Before going with San Diego Solar, I received quotes from others, including people I knew in the industry.  Dirk gave me the best price.  But price was just the beginning.  He determined exactly how many panels were best for my install by studying past electric bills.  He and his crew did a fantastic job timely installing and explaining the system to me.  Dirk helped with the rebates and always took time to answer all my questions (and I had a lot).  In my experience, Dirk is not only an expert in the field he is also an honest businessman that is great to work with.  Thanks to San Diego Solar, I either have no electric bill (summer months) or a very small electric bill. Dirk and his team were great! I have told all my colleagues about him.
